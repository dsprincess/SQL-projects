Here  are my data analysis projects using SQL (MySQL)

**Anime Ratings Analysis**

I'm into anime. However, I only watched those who were famous and not able to explore. Somehow, my only basis for watching an anime is if it is on the most-watched list. So on this data analysis project, I tried to find out the top animes based on different aspects such as score and popularity. I also explored animes by their type (movie or series), genres, and number of episodes.

The insights we gained from this analysis regarding what anime most people enjoy will be incredibly helpful to anime producers and creators.  For future research, it would also be great to study an anime watchers' dataset and perform some sentiment analysis.

**Diamonds analysis**

What makes diamonds rare and expensive? Same with gold and luxurious bagsâ€”could it also be a great investment? In this dataset, I wanted to explore the characteristics of diamonds. Even though I can't afford diamond accessories now, at least I've learned what to purchase and what to include in my investing portfolio in the near future.
