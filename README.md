Here  are my data analysis projects using SQL 

(MySQL)
**Anime Ratings Analysis**

I'm into anime. However, I only watched those who were famous and not able to explore. Somehow, my only basis for watching an anime is if it is on the most-watched list. So on this data analysis project, I tried to find out the top animes based on different aspects such as score and popularity. I also explored animes by their type (movie or series), genres, and number of episodes.

The insights we gained from this analysis regarding what anime most people enjoy will be incredibly helpful to anime producers and creators.  For future research, it would also be great to study an anime watchers' dataset and perform some sentiment analysis.

**Diamonds analysis**

What makes diamonds rare and expensive? Same with gold and luxurious bagsâ€”could it also be a great investment? In this dataset, I wanted to explore the characteristics of diamonds. Even though I can't afford diamond accessories now, at least I've learned what to purchase and what to include in my investing portfolio in the near future.

**Customer Order Analysis**

This another project was a great way to blend my financial background with data analysis and uncover some interesting trends.It involves analyzing sales data from the AdventureWorks database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It combines sales and customer demographic data to provide insights into customer orders and sales performance. The project uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs), JOINs, and window functions to aggregate sales data by year and product category, integrate customer details, and calculate running totals and rankings.
